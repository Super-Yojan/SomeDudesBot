- It will be either Slash commands or just a regular command, like `&&get_chal` 
- That will send out the DM, the challenge to the user
- Then the user will have to basically either upload a file, or copy paste the code
- Then you get the file/code, send it to a server (Which I will be working on) that will take the code and check if it works. For now it can only take Python, Java, JavaScript, Rust, Go,C,C++.
- The response from the server will be JSON, and will contain if they solved it, and the time it took. 
- Based on the response from the server, the bot will assign different roles to the user.
